Programming Languages are FORMAL LANGUAGES which are designed to express computations.

Python follow PEMDAS i.e Parentheses, Exponentiation, (Multiplication, Division), (Addition, Subtraction)
If operators have same precedence like  (Multiplication, Division) then they are evaluated left to right.
Eg - 20/4*2 ## First Division then multiplication --> 10.0
20*4/20     ## First Multiplication then division --> 4.0

String Concatenation - +
String Repetition    - *
